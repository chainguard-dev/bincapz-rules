# bincapz-samples

This repository contains samples used for developing and testing bincapz rules.

There are several categories organized within their own directories:

- `does-nothing`
- `javascript`
- `linux`
- `macOS`
- `npm`
- `php`
- `python`
- `typescript`
- `windows`

Each directory contains both clean and unclean samples.

The purpose of this repository is to be cloned so that bincapz can be run against all or a subset of the samples.
